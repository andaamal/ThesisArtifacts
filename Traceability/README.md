## 1- Report Generation Template [SmartHome.txt](SmartHome.txt)
This is the report generation template that reads block definition and requirements diagrams in SysML model created by Cameo Systems Modeler. 
We implemented this template to create a DSL descriptions that can be imported by DOORS using DXL library.

## 3- MI-DSL Classes [MI-DSL-classes.txt](MI_DSL_Classes.txt):
We used MI-DSL language to define SysML classes. These classes descripe the SysML models and used to create the DXL Library to import SysML models in DOORS tool.
