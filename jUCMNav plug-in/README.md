## jUCMNav Plug-in
This includes function generating files which are the contribution of the thesis and the files that were updated to include the function generating files in the jUCMNav menu:
### 1. Function Generating
* [ExportGRLMath.java](ExportGRLMath.java): exports GRL to one arithmetic functions in SymPy using Arithmetic Semantics for GRL introduced in Section 4.3.1 in the thesis. 
* [ExportGRLMathS.java](ExportGRLMathS.java): exports GRL to split arithmetic functions in SymPy.
* [FeatureToMath.java](FeatureToMath.java): exports feature models to arithmetic functions in SymPy using Arithmetic Semantics for feature models introduced in Section 4.3.2 in the thesis.
### 2. Menu Updating
* [Plugin.properties](plugin.properties)
* [Plugin.xml](plugin.xml)
* [plugin_fr.properties](plugin_fr.properties)
